# Description
This is a front intercooler for the Yokomo YD-2, adjustable, with the support fixed to the body mounts.

# How-to
Prepare 3mm screws and a hex key for the fixations.
Choose a design: "PHS" means "plate screws," "FHS" means "classic screws."
Print the intermediary in a vertical position for greater strength.
Prefer PETG instead of PLA.

# Quality first
- Optimized for 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height.
- Easy to print.
- No support needed.
- Compatible with classic printers like Ender 3.

If you want to add pipes on the sides, you can use Lego Technic pins and flexible lego pipes (Hose, Ribbed 7mm).

Kind regards from France!
